# Wes

Wes aims to be a simple desktop music player.

It's goal is to be a application along the lines of the original Winamp or the original iTunes. If you use a Mac and miss the days of simple desktop music players, Wes might be the thing for you.

Wes was forked from an old application called _Cog_ (see the [orignial readme](#original-readme) section below). I've started stripping things out of the original app I didn't want - last.fm integration, growl notifications, auto update, internet play, and anything else that got in the way of just playing some local files. It's a bit messy in there, but it's close to exactly what I want.

_Cog_ hadn't been updated since 2010 so I've started trying to bring it into 2019. Because it's a bit older, Wes is a bit finicky at the moment, and he sometimes just drops off in the middle of a solo (aka crashes) on some formats.

In general, he works pretty well with the following:

* MP3 (44100, 128bit, 2 channel - other encodings can crash at the moment)
* AAC
* Apple Lossless
* WAV
* AIFF
* Ogg Vorbis (untested)
* FLAC (untested)
* Codecs supported Mac OS X Core Audio API

It can load playlists (and saves them) in the following formats:

* M3U
* PLS (untested)
